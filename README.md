## Project Structure

The main app implementation is inside of the `/app` directory where it uses basic js node implementation.

```sh
"/routes": Routes of the application.
"/lib/db": Database structure. Migrations, seed and types.
"/app/cases": Use cases of your application.
"/app/repositories": Repositores and interfaces that are used by the use cases.

"/node.ts": Initial file to run the project using node.
"/bun.ts": Initial file to run the project using bun.
```

## Tech Stack

**Geral:** [Hono](https://hono.dev), [Zod](https://zod.dev), Eslint  
**Database:** [Kysely](https://kysely.dev) (queries, migrations, types)  
**Test:** [Bun test](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test)

## Requirements

[node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/en) or [bun](https://bun.sh)  
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) installed to manage node versions  
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage dependencies(npm install -g pnpm)

## Run Locally

<details>

<summary>üìÅ Setup your database</summary>

I recommend using [dbngin](https://dbngin.com) to spin up an local DB on your machine.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you prefer docker, you can use postgres service from [this docker compose](https://gist.github.com/marcosrjjunior/d5250416b5fe43d982f998c0b7744464)

Create your database

```
CREATE DATABASE project
```

</details>

#### **Update your environment variables**

Create a `.env` files from `.env.example` and populate the values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

#### **Install your dependencies**

<details>

<summary>Nodejs</summary>

```sh
nvm use
pnpm install
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bun</summary>

```sh
bun install
```

</details>

#### **Run the project**

<details>

<summary>Nodejs</summary>

```sh
pnpm node:dev or pnpm dev
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bun</summary>

```sh
pnpm bun:dev
```

</details>

From here you should be getting a server running on `http://localhost:3333`

## Manage your database using migrations

Migrations are currently defined under `lib/db/migrations`. An initial migration is already there as an example, adjust to meet your project requirements. [Reference](https://kysely.dev/docs/migrations)

Run all migrations

```sh
pnpm db:migrate:up
```

> This command will perform the "up" function for all new migrations

Rollback previous migration

```sh
pnpm db:migrate:down
```

> This command will perform the "down" function from previous migration

Run seed

```sh
pnpm db:seed
```

Reset migrations + run seed

```sh
pnpm db:reset
```

#### How to write a migration

To make an update on the database you will need to create a migration

Run the command

```sh
pnpm db:migrate:create
```

This will generate a new file under `/lib/db/migrations/DATE-initial.ts`

- Rename the file to describe what the migration will do e.g `DATE-adding_phone_column_to_user.ts`

- Functions **up** and **down** should work.

##### DB types

This project is using kanel to generate types, it handles better types and enums when using with postgres.  
If you need to use a different database, I recommend [kysely-codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen) instead.

## Run test

Tests are implemented using bun which follows a jest-compatible structure.

```sh
pnpm test
```

> Reference: https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test#run-tests

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>Why this structure?</summary>

This is a matter of personal preference and depends on your application and deployment process.

I've been using this case structure for a while and have found it enjoyable, though I'm still improving and learning as I go.

I often aim for a balanced approach to structure for various reasons.

As a personal recommendation, try not to become too attached to any one framework. You‚Äôll gain more value by focusing on structuring your code and learning about patterns that can benefit your team, projects, and clients.

Feel free to adapt these ideas to fit your needs.

<details>

<summary>Framework agnostic?</summary>

Thanks to Hono's simplicity, you can structure your project in a way that suits your needs.

The core of this project is located in the /app directory, where I use only JavaScript; none of these files are specific to Hono. This means that if you ever need to switch away from Hono for any reason, you can simply copy the /app directory and adjust the request handling as needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bun or node?</summary>

Thanks to this structure, I can easily switch between them for testing. However, I still recommend using Node.js.

It really depends on your project and situation. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to test it in a large-scale real-world project yet, so I can‚Äôt say for sure. However, Bun is expected to be more efficient and use less memory.

Currently, I'm using Bun to run my tests, and it works well since it‚Äôs [based on Jest](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test).

[Features](https://hono.dev/top#features)

Based on my experience with Express.js and Fastify, I‚Äôve found Hono to be powerful, easy to use, and supported by an active community.

Give it a try.

Here are some basic benchmarks (though they‚Äôre not particularly significant).  
[Requests benchmark](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/result?f=express,hono,fastify,hono-bun)  
[Compare benchmark](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/compare?f=express,hono,fastify,hono-bun)

If you're still not convinced, Fastify is also an excellent option.

## Dependencies

**Nodejs**

> To run the project using nodejs, we need some extra dependencies.
> These are already set in the project.

```
// dependencies
@hono/node-server

// devDependencies
typescript
tsx
```

## Extras

#### Adding sentry

- For the setup you can use the [hono middleware](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/sentry) created for that, you can follow the instructions on the readme there.

The setup is basically adding the middleware on the initial file.

```ts
...
import { sentry } from '@hono/sentry'
...

app.use(
  '*',
  sentry({
    dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DNS,
    tracesSampleRate: isProduction ? 0.2 : 0.8,
    environment,
  }),
)
```

Then you can call on your global `app.onError`

```ts
app.onError((error, c) => {
  c.get('sentry').captureException(e, {
    tags: {}, // any tag
    extra: {}, // any extra object
  })

  return c.json({ error, message: error.message || 'Unknown Error' }, 500)
})
```
